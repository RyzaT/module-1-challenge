# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description

This weeks challenge is an on-the-job ticket, meaning we begin with a starter code that needs modification.

A marketing agency has hired us to refractor an existing site and make it more accesible.

- Refractoring a code is similar to cleaning up a code, you improve it without changing what it does.
- This assignment helps to get me to look through code and find points that need correcting.
- Some links were not working and have been fixed.
- Sections of the web page are now grouped together to make editing easier.
